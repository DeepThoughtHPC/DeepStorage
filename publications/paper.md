# Abstract
`SyntenyViz` is a R package that define an analysing pipeline that enable visualising the synteny conservation across species.  `SyntenyViz` enables not only intuitive examination of synteny features and facilitates reconstruction effort of ancestral genomes, but also allows more direct interrogation of gene regulations and gene structures within a gene cluster.
